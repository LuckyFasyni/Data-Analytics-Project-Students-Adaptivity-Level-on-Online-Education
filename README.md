# Students-Adaptivity-Level-on-Online-Education
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Prediction of Student Adaptivity Level on Online Education

## Introducation

Online Education has become a buzzword since the COVID-19 hit the World. Most of the educational institutions went online to continue educational activities while developing countries like Bangladesh took a significant period of time to ensure online education at every education level. Students of several levels also faced many difficulties when they got introduced to online education. It is important for the decision makers of educational institutions to be informed about the effectiveness of online education so that they can take further steps to make it more beneficial for the students. Our main motivation is to contribute to this matter by analyzing the relevant factors associated with online education.

Goals:
* Conduct exploratory data analysis on the relevant factors of student adaptivity level towards online learning.
* Predict the student adaptivity level using Classification Machine Learning.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

### Conclusion

* The most students with higher adaptivity level found in the school and university. The college student have the lowest adaptivity level (0.41 from 3) due to their more practical and more specific material in nature. The early level university students also have low adaptivity level due to the transition between school and university, so they need more real world orientation and asjustment in their new academic environment.


* There is significant difference on the adaptivity level between IT students and non-IT students.


* The better financial level, the higher adaptivity level will the students achieve. This is because they can afford much better internet connectivity. The internet for poor students is mostly provided with mobile data and 3G. The mid has been momstly provided with 4G, both mobile data and WiFi. Lastly, the rich students have mostly used Wifi and been provided with 4G, no one used 2G.


* The 2G network type is the least effective to serve online learning. To improve the adaptivity level, the students should not use 2G network. The higher network type, the higher adaptivity level. The internet service with WiFi and 4G connection is the best.


* There are more students who live in town have high adaptivity level than who do not live in town. The sub-urban students fortuitously suffers higher load shedding, but this does not effect much on their learning effectivity and adaptivity level. The load shedding or internet connection interruption just effect on urban students. The low load shedding leads to better learning experience and improve the adaptivity level by approximately 8 times.

### Recommendation

For online learning institution

* Online learning is the most suited for basic and fundamental knowledge like the material for school and university. The students have already upper middle adaptivity level, so we need to emphasize and improve the content for the school and university material.


* For more exploration, we should try to cover the online learning material for college and find the best way to to present it. There must be a further research on college learning material.


* Since IT students have significantly higher adaptivity level, online learning is not really a problem for them. We need to present more various IT-related learning material.


* There are various level of internet access based on the students' financial condition. The more advanced learning service, such as video live streaming, the higher internet and network capability required. To cover all students, we should offer various package of learning material. We can offer premium, standard, and basic level of online learning material and facility that is adjusted by financial condition and internet access affordability.
  * Premium package, for the most expansive learning material and most advanced learning experience like real time video learning, real time one-on-one discussion, and advanced tools. Which requires high amount of data and the best internet connectivity.
  * Standard package, with almost the same facility as the premium but the real time one-on-one discussion and standard tools which requires less data and friendly for mobile data internet users.
  * Basic package, with the similar expansive learning material but adjusted with the lower internet data service, like using video on demand, discussion in chat, and widely used learning platform service, like YouTube, etc.


For government

* We need an improvement of internet service, provide at least 3G network in all student areas because 2G is very unreliable.


* We need to provide cheaper 4G internet service since it is much needed in online education that is currently being the most common practices everywhere in the country. We can provide it by building free WiFi with 4G network for public access so all students, especially poor-financial students can utilize it to improve their adaptivity level.


* High load shedding is happening more in sub-urban students, but that does not mean it is not a problem for urban students. The low load shedding has more significant influence for the urban students, improving 8 times of their adaptivity level. So we should prioritize to handle the load shedding in urban area by providing a sufficient amount of electricity to meet the demand for online learning and other online activity which is currently and widely used now.
